# bg2eetrans
BG2EE mod to translate the game in an unsupported language starting from existing translation of BGII - ToB and BGEE

Currently, only French is supported but the framework is there to support other languages.

The mod edits BGEE.lua in order to add a new language that can be selected in the game interface. For that reason (accessing BGEE.lua), the mod requires WeiDU 240 to install (or beta 23901 at least).
